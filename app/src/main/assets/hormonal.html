<p>A woman controls hormonal methods and they can be used without a man knowing.</p></div>
<p>Hormonal methods work by preventing the woman’s ovaries from releasing an egg. The hormones also make the mucus at the opening of the womb very thick, which helps stop the sperm from getting inside the womb.</p>
<p>Most birth control pills and some injections contain both estrogen and progestin. These are called ‘combination’ pills or injections. The two hormones work together to give excellent protection against pregnancy. 
However, some women should not use pills or injections with estrogen for health reasons, or because they are breastfeeding (see Who should not take combined pills).</p>
<p>Progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills), implants, and some injections contain only one hormone—progestin. 
These methods are safer than combined pills or injections for women who should not use estrogen, or are breastfeeding.</p>

Side effects often get better after the first 2 or 3 weeks or months. If they do not, and they are annoying or worrying you, see a health worker. She may be able to help you change the amount of the hormones in your method or to change methods. For more information about the specific side effects that are common with each hormonal method, read the sections lower on this page.<div style="clear:both; margin: 0; padding: 0"></div></div>

<p>The pills will not prevent pregnancy immediately. So, during the first 7 days on pills, use condoms or some other backup method to avoid pregnancy.</p></div>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Combined_pills_.28birth_control_pills_with_estrogen_and_progestin.29">Combined pills (birth control pills with estrogen and progestin)</span></h4>
<p>Birth control pills will protect you from pregnancy as long as you take one pill every day. There are many different brands of combined pills with different types of estrogen and progestin in them and different amounts of each hormone. The most common combined pills are “low-dose” pills with 20, 30, or 35 micrograms (mcg) of estrogen. Low-dose pills and minipills are different—lowdose pills have both estrogen and progestin, while the minipill has only progestin. 
</p><p>Combined pills are usually available at family planning clinics, health posts, pharmacies, and through health workers.
</p><p>Once you start taking pills, you should try to stick with one brand (and if you can, buy several packets at once). If you must change brands, try to get another with the same hormone names and strength. You will have fewer side effects and better protection.

<div id="combined"></div>
<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_should_not_take_combined_pills:">Who should not take combined pills:</span></h5>
<p>Some women have health problems that make it dangerous for them to use the pill. 
<b>NEVER take the pill if you have any of the conditions listed above</a>,  </b>
or if you:<b>	</b>
</p>
<ul><li> have liver disease <i>hepatitis</i>, or yellow skin and eyes. 
</li><li> have ever had signs of a <i>stroke</i>, <i>paralysis</i>, or heart disease. 
</li><li> have ever had a <i>blood clot</i> in the <i>veins</i> of your legs, or in your lungs or brain. <i>Varicose</i> veins are usually not a problem, unless the veins are red and sore.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
If you have any of the following health problems, try to use a method other than combined birth control pills. But if you cannot, it is still better to take the combined pill than to become pregnant. <br><b>Try not to take combined pills if you:</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Smoke and are over 35 years old.</b> You have a greater chance of having a stroke or heart attack if you take combined pills
</li><li><b>Have diabetes or epilepsy.</b> If you are taking medicine for seizures (“fits”), you will need to take a stronger (50 micrograms of estrogen) birth control pill. Get medical advice from a health worker or doctor.

<ul><li><b>Irregular bleeding or spotting</b> (bleeding at other times than your normal monthly bleeding). Combined pills often make your monthly bleeding shorter and lighter. It is also normal to sometimes skip your monthly bleeding. This is the most common side effect of combined birth control pills. To reduce spotting, be extra careful to take the pill at the same time every day. If the spotting continues, talk with a health worker to see if changing doses of progestin or estrogen will help.

<ul><li><b>Nausea,</b> the feeling that you want to throw up, usually goes away after 1 or 2 months. If it bothers you, try taking the pills with food or at another time of day. Some women find that taking the pill just before going to sleep at night helps.

<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Before trying implants, be sure a health worker near you is trained and willing to remove the implants, in case you want them removed. It is harder to take implants out than it is to put them in.</div>
<p>Implants can be used by women who are breastfeeding and others who have problems with estrogen. Women should not use implants if they have any of the conditions described above, if they have heart disease, or if they want to become pregnant in the next few years.

This does not mean that you are pregnant or that something is wrong. These changes will go away as your body becomes used to having more progestin. If this irregular bleeding causes problems for you, a health worker may have you take low-dose combined birth control pills along with the implants for a few months. You may also have occasional headaches and the same side effects common with progestin-only injections.

<div class="sidenote boilerplate" style="float:right;clear:right">

<p>In this family planning method, a woman is given injections of hormones every 1 to 3 months, usually at a health center or family planning clinic, by someone who knows how. The protection lasts until you need a new injection, and can be used without others knowing.

<p>Because of the large doses of progestin given with each injection, women experience more changes in their monthly bleeding during the first few months than with other hormonal methods.<br> 
Other common side effects are: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>irregular bleeding or heavy spotting.</b> If this is a problem, a health worker can give 2 cycles of a combined low-dose birth control pill to take along with the injections to stop the spotting. Most irregular bleeding will stop after a few months. 
</li><li><b>no monthly bleeding.</b>
</li><li><b>weight gain.</b>
</li></ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Combined_injections">Combined injections</span></h4>
<p>Other injections, such as Cyclofem and Mesigyna, contain both estrogen and progestin. This type of injection is good for women who want to have regular monthly bleeding. Combined injections are given every month, are more expensive than progestin-only injections, and are harder to find.
</p><p>Women who should not take combined birth control pills or progestin-only injections should not take combined injections either. Do not begin combined injections while breastfeeding until your baby is 6 months old or your monthly bleeding returns, whichever happens first.

<h5> <span class="mw-headline" id="Common_side_effects_of_combined_injections:">Common side effects of combined injections:</span></h5>
<p>Because the injection contains the same hormones as combined birth control pills, the same side effects are common.

It is best to get your first injection during your monthly bleeding. This way you know that you are not pregnant. You can start the injections anytime if you are breastfeeding and have not started your monthly bleeding.

The injection protects you against pregnancy immediately if it is given within 5 days after your monthly bleeding begins. If the injection was given 6 or more days after the beginning of your monthly bleeding, you should use condoms or not have sex for the next 7 days. 

You must have an injection every 1, 2, or 3 months, depending on the kind of injection: 
</p><ul><li> <i>Depo	Provera</i>: every 3 months 
</li><li> <i>Noristerat:</i> every 2 months 
</li><li> <i>Cyclofem and Mesigyna:</i> every month 
</li></ul>
<br>
Try not to be late getting injections. The injection becomes less effective the longer you wait. If you are late, use a barrier method, or do not have sexual intercourse for 7 days after the injection.

<p>You can stop having birth control injections any time you want. But after you stop, it can take a year or more to become pregnant and for your monthly bleeding to return to normal. But it also may come back sooner. So if you do not want to become pregnant right away, you must use another family planning method during this time.
